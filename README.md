# Memory Game

This game is a recreation of the classic memory game. A player has to find all pairs of cards to win the game.

Each turn the player selects two cards by clicking on them. A color coding will indicate whether the combination of cards is a match (green) or no match(red). For each wrong move a non-visible counter will be decreased. Currently it is set to 12, which means the player is allowed 11 wrong moves before losing the game.
